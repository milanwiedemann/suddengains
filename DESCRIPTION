Description: Identify sudden gains based on the criteria outlined by Tang and DeRubeis (1999). It 
    applies all three criteria to a dataset while adjusting for missing values. It calculated further variables
    that are of interest. It handles multiple gains by creating two datasets, one structured by sudden gain and 
    one by participant. It also implements a function to specify which sudden gains to choose in case of multiple gains
    (earliest or largest gain). See the GitHub repository for more information and examples.
