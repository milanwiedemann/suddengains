Description: Identify sudden gains based on the criteria outlined by Tang and DeRubeis (1999). Sudden losses, defined as the opposite of sudden gains can also be identified. It 
    applies all three criteria to a dataset while adjusting the third criteria for missing values. It handles multiple gains per person by creating two datasets, one with all sudden gains and 
    one with one selected sudden gain for each participant. It can extract and plot scores around sudden gains on multiple measures. See the GitHub repository for more information and examples.
