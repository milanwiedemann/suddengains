# suddengains: R package for identifying sudden gains in psychological therapies

here some random notes, need to tidy this up at some point!
some functions wont work if the measure of the variable that the sudden gains are being analysed on starts with "sg".
this will conflict with the variables that get created for the bysg and byperson datasets.
there I think it shold be recommended to rename variables in this special case!
